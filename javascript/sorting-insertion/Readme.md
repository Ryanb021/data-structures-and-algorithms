# Insertion Sort

## Assignment

- Review the pseudocode below, then trace the algorithm by stepping through the process with the provided sample array. Document your explanation by creating a blog article that shows the step-by-step output after each iteration through some sort of visual.

- Once you are done with your article, code a working, tested implementation of Insertion Sort based on the pseudocode provided.

### Pseudocode

- Insert(int[] sorted, int value)
  initialize i to 0
  WHILE value > sorted[i]
    set i to i + 1
  WHILE i < sorted.length
    set temp to sorted[i]
    set sorted[i] to value
    set value to temp
    set i to i + 1
  append value to sorted

- InsertionSort(int[] input)
  LET sorted = New Empty Array
  sorted[0] = input[0]
  FOR i from 1 up to input.length
    Insert(sorted, input[i])
  return sorted
