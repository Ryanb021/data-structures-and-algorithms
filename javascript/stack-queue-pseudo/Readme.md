# Code Challenge 11

## Stack and Queue Pseudo

- Implement a Queue using two Stacks.

## Specifications

- Read all of these instructions carefully.
- Name things exactly as described.
- Do all your work in a your data-structures-and-algorithms public repository.
- Create a new branch in your repo named as noted below.
- Follow the language-specific instructions for the challenge type listed below.
- Update the “Table of Contents” - in the README at the root of the repository - with a link to this challenge’s README file.

## Notes

- *Stack and Queues are collections, linear data structures with the same meaning that they do in everyday life.*
- With Stack, you can only add or remove things from the top of the Stack. Last In First Out (LIFO). Operations used in Stack:
    - push: Add to the Stack
    - pop: Remove from the Stack
    - peek: Look at the last item in the Stack without adding or removing it
- With Queue, almost similar to Stack but the primary difference is with Queue, it First In First Out (FIFO). Operations used in Queue:
    - enqueue: Add to the Queue
    - dequeue: Remove from the Queue
